TTV Day Counter

TTV Day Counter is a mod that allows you to display your current day on OBS, StreamLabs or any other streaming software as a simple browser source.
The reason TTV Day Counter was made is due to the fact that I personally stream and always wanted a day count display on my stream without it being display one my minecraft 24/7 and having to check the F3 menu. I thought of this idea and had no idea what I was doing with Java but gave it a go. With the help of some awesome people from discord communities and stack overflow I managed to create this simple Day Counter. I hope this is of some use to you and thank you for checking it out!
